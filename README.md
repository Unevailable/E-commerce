## Installation
I first started by creating a git repo, after that I pulled the repo onto my repos folder and created the necessary files and folder for the project. I proceeded to copy the starter code and installed MySql2, Sequelize, and dotenv package. Soon after i went to work on the neccasary code that needed to be added in the back end. I ran into some problems and used the slack assistant and Xpert learning to help fix those problems. After all that was done I checked to see if the code ran properly on insomina. Lastly I added a readme file and pushed all the updates to my repo.

## Usage
to use it you want to head to the directory of the file and in git bash or cmd prompt you type node index.js to start the program. It will give you prompts for you to input an answer for example "Enter up to three characters." you would input three characters and hit enter. Afterward, it will generate an SVG Logo.

## Contributing
I used Xpert Learning Assistant, starter code, and slack assistant. 

## Tests
The project results are shown in the video.
