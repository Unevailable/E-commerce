## Installation
I first started by creating a git repo, after that I pulled the repo onto my repos folder and created the necessary files and folder for the project. I proceeded to copy the starter code and installed MySql2, Sequelize, and dotenv package. Soon after I went to work on the necessary code that needed to be added in the back end. I ran into some problems and used the Slack assistant and Xpert Learning to help fix those problems. After all that was done, I checked to see if the code ran properly on Insomnia. Lastly, I added a readme file and pushed all the updates to my repo.

## Usage
The purpose of the program is so that companies can use this program to update items in their E-commerce store. To use it you'll need the right npms installed after that start a SQL server doing MySQL -u root -p, input your password then run source db/schema.sql after that quit, next do run seed and then npm run watch nodemon to run the server on to insomnia. 

## Contributing
I used Xpert Learning Assistant, starter code, and Slack assistant. 

## Tests
The test was run through insomina. The project results are shown in the video.
